# Bert_Model_Basics

This file containes the basic implementation of the Bert preprocessing model and Bert Encoder to convert words and sentences into embedding vectors.

Bert Preprocessing model is used to apply tokenization, padding and adding tokens to mark the beginning and end of the sentence. that is all done by the pretrained bert pre processing model and that is done so that the encoder model can process that data to convert them into embedding vectors with their contextual meaning.
